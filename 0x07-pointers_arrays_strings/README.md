# About Folder

This folder still falls under the concept of arrays, pointers, strings and functios. I have been exposed to concept of double pointers, multi dimenesional arrays and as such am going to be writing functions that works same way as the standard functions in string.h

## Contents

* memset():a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

* memcpy(): a function that copies memory area.

* strchr(): a function that locates a character in a string.

* stsspn(): a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

* strpbrk():  a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.

* strstr(): a function that locates a substring.The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared

* Function that add the diagonals of a square matrix
* Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
